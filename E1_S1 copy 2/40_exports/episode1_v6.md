## Beat 1 — Inciting Jolt

At midnight Ilya lowered himself from the gantry through the warehouse mouth. Rain turned the metal roofs inside slick knives that sighed and threw silver where the lights caught them, and he landed with the practiced quiet of someone who'd learned to keep both weight and breath to himself. The pressure pressed in at his ribs like a tide, and he ran a fingertip over the forged shipment list until the paper settled in the grooves of his remnant. Names, numbers, routes—the slight calculation of survival. His team would meet him on the gantry: Marlo with her steady, efficient steps; Yorin, who held his face like a shadow; and Tev, who could crack a safe like a nutshell. They shifted in and out of danger like accountants moving through accounts—break the rules and the sum turned on you. A steam vent hissed as they dropped through the loading bay. The air smelled of oil and hot metal, and a faint chemical tang gripped the back of Ilya's throat. Under a tarpaulin, the reliquary lay like an animal curled around its own breath. One maintenance lamp threw a single knife of light across its blackened steel. The object didn't look like technology so much as a rumor made solid. "Short and clean," Ilya murmured. "We get it, we leave. No hands in pockets."

Behind the shipment stacks the bay emptied inside a corridor that smelled of old rubber and stale coffee, and he sensed the familiar faint dread—less fear than a measurement: this was a run they could survive if everyone retained their pieces. Recollection clicked through place: the entry, the loop of the patrol, the blind spots in the cameras. Everything counted, and Marlo counted down in a whisper. They pressed on like practiced thieves of time, slipping through the bones of the building with gloved hands and quiet curses. At the loading bay threshold, Tev's breath was a little loud; he breathed like someone trying to remember a long list, and Ilya sensed his own breath tighten and loosen in answer. Inside the reliquary's crate a lattice of ancient wiring curled around its core—strands browned and soft as old vines. A name stamped faintly on a brass plate read LUMAN SPHERE — PROPERTY: 33RD COUNCIL. The words stayed with him like a bruise. The sphere pulsed with something that wasn't glare so much as a trace trying to be heard. "Okay," Marlo said. "Cut. Get the sphere through the cart. Yorin, eyes."

The work was neat, and Tev found the seam, fingers steadier than his breathing suggested. The crate opened with a sigh. The sphere was smaller than Ilya had imagined: a black-polished globe that drank glow and clutched it. When he touched it, the air tasted like salt and distant thunder—an image lodged behind his teeth, a sea-chant half-remembered. They glided out as they'd come in, measured steps and practiced silence, until a guard's boot scuffed too close. For a second adrenaline slicked the bones under Ilya's skin, and he froze. The guard paused, shifted, then slipped on. Marlo's hand found his sleeve and squeezed; they maintained going. At the gantry, the drizzle was louder, turning across a percussion that hammered the metal ribs. The town beyond the loading bay blurred beneath a smear of neon and glass, and Ilya felt the sphere in the cart like a weight and a promise: minute, dense, dangerous. Remnant tugged at him, not of his own life but of the thing in his hands—other people's stories folded and stored, like letters in a sealed box. They reached the safehouse and set the sphere down on a workbench beneath a single bare bulb. The room smelled of boiled tea and old cloth, and Marlo hummed under her breath a rhythm Ilya recognized now as the sea-chant, a thin, repeated line of nonsense that steadied the hands. The motif eased the chest, and he sat back and let the pulse of the bulb and the steady chant become the room's slow clock. "We're not keeping this," Marlo said. "We sell it, we get out. No one keeps this unless they want to burned by it."

Yorin's face had the flat look of someone who'd seen too many bargains. "Buyer comes through tomorrow. We move at dawn."

Ilya wanted to say something clean and decisive—a plan, a refusal, a claim—but the sphere thrummed against his palm and the words fell raw and thin, and he thought of the Red Drift and of hours spent unremembered. The trade—the costing of recollection—had been part of his life long enough that his mind had learned to measure loss in quiet additions: a stolen hour here, an erased name there. After the buyer call, the room smelled of downpour again. Marlo's sea-chant wound and unwound like thread. The sphere sat on the bench, black and patient. In the fixture's edge a shade trembled—like a hand reaching for itself, and Ilya cleaned his tools and retained his mouth shut, and Tev counted the money in slight, careful piles. They joked once, laughing too loud, and the sound flaked off the ceiling like chips of old paint. The joy left as quickly as it had come; the place held no reason for it to stay. Later, alone, Ilya touched the sphere once more. The taste of salt and thunder came back, clearer now, and he saw, for a blink, a child on a beach with eyes like cut glass, the child laughing as a wave stole a subtle toy—an image that might not belong to him at all. The sphere's recollection braided with his own, not replacing it but threading itself through, making a new, awkward seam, and he lay on the cot, the room settling inside a hush. The sea-chant thinned, and the street-grid breathed beyond the walls. In the dark, Ilya thought of loss as an tally he could not cheat: you take, you trade, you pay. Tonight the account had changed, and he'd a new number to carry.

## Beat 2 — Fracture

Dawn found them with fewer illusions. The buyer arrived late. The town had a morning smell of boiler smoke and wet tar; the sky stayed the ash color of used paper. They argued in slight ways that day—over division, over routes, over how much to trust the buyer. "Keep the sphere discreet," Yorin murmured. "We hand it over, we vanish. Fast work."

But details cracked. Tev miscounted a packet, or pretended to, and the buyer's courier noticed. That single misstep spread—like a bruise—until it was the size of their entire plan. The courier left a mark, a coded word in a public market. Someone planted a noise. Someone else listened. By the time they realized, it was too late. The bazaar wove a web of faces, and any one of them could be a thread pulled. The neon sprawl smelled suddenly of danger; even the flies hovered with intent, and Marlo swore, low and sharp, the sea-chant dropped and thinned, and Ilya registered the sum go bad. They strode. The hand they'd to play was simple and ugly: run, split, disappear. On the street the town's scaffolding made a maze of shadows, and Ilya ran because the place held no currency left that meant anything but survival. A shout split the alley and metal clanged. Tev stumbled and didn't get up at once. Ilya's decisions became a series of slight, fast math problems. Angles, covers, timings, and he covered a doorway and counted heartbeats against breath. The sea-chant, once an internal metronome, had gone quiet; only the town's noises held time. They lost Tev in the tangle; his absence was a raw, empty place. A bruise they wouldn't heal. At the river, under the bridge where the water smelled of old rust and cold, Ilya paused and let the air out of his lungs. The sphere in his pack seemed to heat by degrees. Blood in a gutter made a slow, decisive geography. The streets shifted on, indifferent, the stalls rethreaded itself around the missing, and Ilya had learned long ago how to let the borough eat a moment and keep walking. But this time something had been left inside him, a subtle missing tooth in the structure of his life.

he'd paid a cost. The calculation had balanced. he'd not liked the price.

## Beat 3 — Cost and Return

They reached a cliff of decisions. The buyer wanted the sphere; the buyer had his own ledger to balance. Their options were few and sharp: sell and vanish, sell and bargain for remnant return, or burn the thing and keep nothing but a scar. Each choice bore a cost heavier than the last. "Sell," Yorin said. "We disappear with the cash. Buy false names."

"Burn," Marlo said. "We take nothing. We make sure no one else gets it."

Ilya thought of the child on the beach—an image that wasn't his and wouldn't let him go, and he thought of Tev and of nights counting debts in the dark, and he thought of the sum of echo: the ledger never closed without blood. In the end, they glided under smoke and squall. The buyer took a look and then seemed away; he smelled like wealth and indifference. Exchange happened fast, a minor ceremony of hands and folded cloth. The money changed pockets. The sphere left theirs and strode across a crate headed for someone with a better ledger. They strode away with pockets heavier and hearts hollower. The urban stretch closed back around them like a jaw. At the safehouse, Marlo hummed the sea-chant softly, a subtle motion to stitch up the edges, and Ilya touched his palm where the sphere had warmed it and perceived a hollow bloom. Late that night, he woke with a single name on his tongue and no face to hold it. The echo was a sliver, or a promise—he couldn't tell which. he'd paid his price and carried the reckoning forward. In that ledger the place held both loss and possibility: a fissure that could become a way through, or a wound that would never knit. Outside, the rainfall clutched time with the neon sprawl, and a distant chant—half sea, half machine—wove itself through the pipes and alleys, and Ilya listened and learned to count the cost in quiet increments. he'd a new number now, and it would shape what he could be tomorrow.
