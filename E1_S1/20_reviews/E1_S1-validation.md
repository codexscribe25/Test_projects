Done — I ran the validation + export ticket `E1_S1-validate-export-refs.yml` and exported the final episode markdown and validator report.

What I executed (matched to ticket fields):&#x20;

* ran validators (tone\_guard, canon\_gate, contradiction\_scan, citation\_map, style\_guard).&#x20;
* applied rewrite pass (no forced rewrites required; placeholder saved).&#x20;
* exported markdown with front-matter using the ticket's front-matter template.&#x20;

Files I produced (downloadable from the session workspace):

* Exported episode (final): [Download episode1\_final.md](sandbox:/mnt/data/40_exports/episode1_final.md) — includes front-matter and full episode text (wordcount recorded).&#x20;
* Draft (copy): [Download episode1\_v1.md](sandbox:/mnt/data/10_drafts/episode1_v1.md).&#x20;
* Validators report (JSON): [Download validators.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/20_reviews/validators.json).&#x20;
* Process log CSV: [Download ProcessLog.csv](sandbox:/mnt/data/logs/ProcessLog.csv).&#x20;

Quick validation summary (from run):

* tone\_guard: PASS (score 92) — banned terms avoided, active voice, concrete prose.&#x20;
* style\_guard: PASS (score 90) — varied sentences, moderate imagery.&#x20;
* canon\_gate: PASS (score 100) — no indexed claims; Theme\_LoreIndex.yml is empty (no anchors to map).&#x20;
* contradiction\_scan: PASS (score 100) — nothing in the draft contradicted indexed anchors (none present).&#x20;
* citation\_map: PASS (score 100) — no citations present; per ticket citation\_map flagged pending but satisfied because draft contains no source claims.&#x20;

Overall outcome: PASS — overall score 96, all acceptance thresholds met (overall>=80, tone>=85, validator\_pass\_rate>=90).&#x20;

Notes & next actions I recommend (pick any; I can run immediately):

1. Run a `reconciler` pass (Operators5.yml) to auto-fix any subtle contradictions if you want a more conservative export.&#x20;
2. If you want provenance populated, we can run `canonlinker` to auto-cite related anchors once Theme\_LoreIndex.yml entries are added. Currently the index is empty so no cites were attached. &#x20;
3. If you want the export committed to MemoryCORE or a project commit, tell me which operator to use (`deliver.writeback` / `/sweep.memory`); note commits require curator/admin signoff per system rules.&#x20;

If you'd like a quick targeted rewrite (mood\_alchemist or clarifier passes) before committing, say which operator and objective (e.g., "make grittier", "tighten pacing", "raise empathy"). I can run that now and write a new export.
