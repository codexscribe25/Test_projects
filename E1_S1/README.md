# E1_S1 â€” Episode 1 (Story-first)

Lean starter for a short production test. Draft first, research after. Keep everything IP-agnostic.

## Folders
- 00_inputs: premise/tone/index
- 10_drafts: first-pass episode
- 20_reviews: validators + human notes
- 30_rewrites: addressed draft
- 40_exports: final markdown/pdf (add later)
- logs: ProcessLog.csv

## How to run
1) Write the episode from `00_inputs/premise.md`.
2) Post-draft research using `Theme_LoreIndex.yml` (optional).
3) Run validators, capture `20_reviews/validators.json`.
4) Rewrite and export to `40_exports/episode1_final.md`.
