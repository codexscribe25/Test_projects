#   Create a REFS-style IDEATE ticket YAML for E1_S1 that:
#     - references Theme_Styleguide.yml and Theme_LoreIndex.yml
#     - generates 8 loglines (<=35 words)
#     - scores each by: hook_strength, clarity, tone_fit, novelty
#     - expands top 2 into 3-beat outlines and an opening paragraph (<=110 words)

    Reliable, iterative ideation for E1_S1 that enforces strict input precedence
    and human-in-the-loop refinement. Uses 00_inputs/* as primary seeds and

        You are an ideation assistant. Follow these strict rules:
        1) USE ONLY this seed source for creative generation: artifacts/01_ideation_pool_sanitized_<ts>.json
        2) USE Theme/Theme_Styleguide.yml only for tone phrasing guidance (do NOT use Theme or Memory as facts/seeds).
        3) Produce up to {{params.ideas}} candidate loglines. For each candidate:
           - ID (C01...), 1–2 sentence logline (<=35 words), 1-sentence expansion, 1-line risk note, 2–4 tags.
        4) Provide a small JSON block at the end with candidates and raw scores (hook_strength, clarity, tone_fit, novelty).
        5) If you cannot produce at least 3 unique creative candidates from the sanitized seeds, output 2–3 ask-user clarification seeds and halt.
        TONE: follow Theme/Theme_Styleguide.yml for phrasing only.
