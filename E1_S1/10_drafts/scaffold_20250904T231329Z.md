Beats:
1) Inciting jolt — The Job Drops: Ilya receives a forged manifest and a photo — a midnight private auction at Warlord Karo's warehouse; the pay is ruinous.
2) Complication — Fortified Routine, Human Unknowns: rooftop entry and service ducts; thermal sweeps and staggered rotations force improvisation; a humming child in the loading bay reveals a human tie to the reliquary.
3) Choice & Cost — Get It or Save Them: extraction triggers lockdown; Ilya must choose the reliquary (and payment) or stall to free innocents, risking capture.

POV: Close third-person (Ilya)

Stakes:
- Immediate: escape before the second-shift thermal sweep.
- Human: pressed workers and stowaways at risk.
- Cost: death, imprisonment, loss of moral redemption, and a strengthened warlord.

Hooks:
1) The reliquary's inscription links to a coastal ritual tied to Ilya's past.
2) A guard's watch-data chip points to a black-market buyer with political ties.
3) The child's sea chant gives Ilya a personal reason to return.

Opening line: At midnight Ilya lowered himself from the gantry into the warehouse mouth; rain turned metal roofs into whispering knives.
