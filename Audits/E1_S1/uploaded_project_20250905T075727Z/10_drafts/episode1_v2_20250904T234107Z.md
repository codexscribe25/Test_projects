into whispering knives.
He ran a fingertip along the forged shipment list as if the ink could tell him the lies it contained.
Ilya had been a dock-hand once, a man used to the rhythm of tides and rope and the honest ache of labor.
Now the tide paid him in coin and danger, and the job was simple on paper: slip in, take a reliquary, leave before dawn.
The shipment list named the target as 'household relics'—a coded lie for the kind of sacred things warlords sell behind locked doors.
His team would meet him on the gantry; Marlo with the clamps, Sera with the forged wrist-tags.
and quiet Kito who never liked to speak until he needed to.
The rooftop gantry smelled of wet tar and old oil; the city below was a smeared ribbon of lamps and fog.
They moved like shadows stitched to shadow, boots muffled by fabric and the patience of men who had learned the art of not being seen.
Thermal sweeps hissed in scheduled arcs and black-clad guards walked patterns learned from the same old maps.
A mist of steam rose from vents, and in it something small and human slipped—a child humming under a crate, a voice that made Ilya's throat close.
Inside the loading bay the reliquary lay under a tarpaulin like a sleeping thing; its metal caught a single beam of light and tossed it back like a.
dare.
Sera's hand hovered over the clamps, and Kito's breath fogged the air as if he could blow away luck itself.
Alarms are not just bells; they are arithmetic—counts and loops that turn a thirty-minute window into a closing trap.
When the partial lockdown began the lights shuttered into narrow cones and the corridors stitched closed like a fist.
Ilya saw the child then.
not a silhouette but a small face streaked with grime and wonder; the hymn she'd hummed was a sea-chant his mother used to hum when the harbor lights were still honest.
The reliquary's value warmed the back of his neck like a fever; the payment would fix everything if they could pull it off.
Choice was a clean knife: run with the prize and break the child's future, or risk everything to free someone who would not pay them a coin.
Ilya felt the old dock-ache, the urge to fix what could be fixed; his hands clenched around the rope and the world narrowed to a single breath.
He moved toward the tarp with one hand and toward the child's hiding with the other—then made the kind of decision that made stories and crimes both.
They did not leave unmarked; boots thudded, a chip clattered, an alarm began to call numbers into the dark.
Somewhere down the wharf a watch-data chip pinged a black-market buyer; a thread had been pulled that would not stop.
The reliquary hummed cold in Ilya's bag, an object that belonged to tides and rituals and older promises.
The child's chant followed him like an accusation and a map, the sound of a past that demanded he return.
They scattered into rain and alleys, lighter for having taken and heavier for what they had seen — and the world spun a little different than before.
Rain ticked like a slow metronome against corrugated roofs and the city tasted of oil and brine.

The city's smell was always a promise and a threat at once: smoke, salt, and rope tar.
Ilya's hands remembered knots; they moved by recollection when thought failed him.

Marlo whistled a line to count time, soft and strange as a seam in the dark.
