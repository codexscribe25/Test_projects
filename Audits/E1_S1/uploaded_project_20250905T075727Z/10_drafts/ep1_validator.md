Validator summary (ticket validators: tone_guard, style_guard).

Tone guard (style + banned-term check): PASS. I avoided the project banned terms and kept diction concrete and active in line with the style guide.

Style guard (sentence-length and voice): PASS. Prose uses varied sentence lengths and predominantly active voice per rules.

Notes on constraints:

Theme-first constraints: This draft avoids invented world tokens and faction names â€” the project policy asked that no specific world be used until indexed.

Lore citations: Theme_LoreIndex is empty, so there were no canonical entries to cite for in-world facts; the draft was written to be self-contained and not to assert indexed facts.
