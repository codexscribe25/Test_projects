Fresh 10 seeds (no Aetheris, no memory)

1. A streetlamp keeper discovers lamps that store weather instead of oil — lighting a street can summon fog, hail, or a clear sunset.
2. A glassmaker blows panes that perfectly reflect tomorrow’s sky for one hour; buyers build fortunes (and superstitions) around the brief forecasts.
3. A bridgewright carves tolls into the stones themselves; cross one and your luck shifts slightly toward whatever the stone was paid for.
4. A market runs on barter-rituals where poems pay for goods — the worst verse costs twice as much as the best.
5. A tide-harvester rigs coastal inlets to bottle sea-sounds; composers use the bottles to write music that heals seasick sailors.
6. A cartography guild maps wind-ghosts — invisible currents that move lost flags and unravel stitched sails.
7. A baker’s new yeast ferments time into the crust: eat yesterday’s loaf to recall a day’s taste, but snacks age the eater's patience.
8. Nightwatchers hunt bioluminescent graffiti that blooms only on abandoned walls after rain; each bloom reveals one local secret.
9. An archivist of broken machines runs a repair salon where restoring a device transfers one small flaw to the restorer.
10. A ferry captain pilots on the city’s reflected map: the river’s surface shows an alternate route that leads to places the pilot must decide to believe.
