# Chapter Seeds (Lore-free)

**Seed 01 — City of Borrowed Names**

A newcomer learns the city loans you a name until you’ve earned your own; their borrowed name belongs to a criminal legend.

**Seed 02 — River Without Bridges**

A river rises an inch every hour; ferries stop running; a stranded district must cross at street-level before it’s cut off for good.

**Seed 03 — The Archivist’s Key**

A library closes for renovation; a junior archivist finds a key that opens a shelf not listed on any plan.

**Seed 04 — Door Twelve**

An apartment building has eleven numbered doors; the superintendent keeps a blank space where Twelve should be—until a tenant returns with photos of it.

**Seed 05 — Signal Hill**

A hilltop repeater starts rebroadcasting messages from five years in the future—only the first minute of each hour.

**Seed 06 — Night Watch**

A volunteer night watch pairs a skeptic with a believer to investigate calls about ‘standing shadows’ that only appear on the third floor of old houses.

**Seed 07 — Department of Found Things**

An intake clerk in the city’s Lost & Found realizes some items were never lost here—yet belong to people in the queue.

**Seed 08 — Blackout Guest**

During a rolling blackout, a host realizes the polite guest at their table doesn’t match anyone’s invite.

**Seed 09 — The Quiet Street**

One street goes completely quiet every night from 2:14–2:16 a.m.—no sound, no wind; a delivery driver decides to park there and wait.

**Seed 10 — Paper Walls**

In a shared house, thin walls carry voices from a conversation that hasn't happened yet—between roommates who don’t like each other.
